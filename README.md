### Hello!

I am currently working as a consultant in the Salesforce industry.  My firm focuses on writing full, custom web applications on top of the Salesforce platform. We think of Salesforce more as a platform than stricly a CRM.  It is amazing what you can do with some custom development effort. 

My skillset incldues 
- Java
- Apex (salesforce backend language)
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- I have dabbled in AWS, GCP, and Heroku over the years.

I am open for consulting work in the Salesforce or Java ecosystems.
