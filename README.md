### Hello!

I currently work as a consultant in the Salesforce ecosystem, specializing in building fully custom web applications on top of Salesforce. Our team views Salesforce not just as a CRM but as a versatile development platform, unlocking endless possibilities with the proper custom development efforts.

#### Noteworthy Projects
- At Interactive Intelligence I was part of the team that was focused on hardening our installation utility and improving it's performance.  The VoIP technology that I worked on was an on-prem solution and was physically installed on a customers own servers.  The platform was rather large and took a very long time to install.  When I came on, the installer would do a full removal of the old version and a full install of the new version when updating. My team focused on converting our installer to actually be able to handle patches for incremental updates and (we started releasing these patches quarterly) in-place upgrades for new versions.  These 2 things drastically increased the speed of installs.  During this time, we were also clearing out our backlog of bugs present in the installer.  Oncew we were done, the installer was much faster and we had cleared out all of the bugs.  As the installer didn't need much changing over time, it became mostly self-sufficient after this project. We utilized C++ and WIX (Windows XML) for this project. We had to interact with the Windows Service OS significantly and had to learn to navigate it with great detail. 
- At Campus Education, I performed the full designed and implementaiton of a logging microservice.  This service communicated with the rest of the mircroservices via a REST api and had full authentication. This microservice was written with Java 17, utilizing Spring Boot and Java JPA for data access.  It utilized a PostgreSQL relational database (where I would probably use some kind of NoSQL technology today. we didn't have anyone with the experience with that tech back then). Each microservice in the stack would be able to asynchronously send off messages to the Logger and be able to keep on going with it's business without needing to wait on a response. This helped speed up out platform overall as the orignally logging implementation was just housed in each microservice directly and would take up system resources on that server.
- At Zinc Partners, I have made sweeping changes over the years.  One of my first projects was implementing Source Control for our largest client.  We had 5 developers dedicated to this client, full-time, for 3 years before I came in without any source control.  Quality was all over the place, bugs were rampant, and releases took 10+ FTE hours to complete.  After implementing source control and a specific implementation of a Feature Branching scheme, we were able to improve the quality of our output drastically.  Utilizing Git and Bitbucket, I implemented code reviews and automated builds that ran specific unit tests on your PRs automatically. Towards the end of my first year, our client brought on a customer that almost doubled their system usage at the time.  We spent the last 3 months of the year in extreme high-speed mode getting everything done they needed done by EoY.  Without the source control, quality control, and automations that I put in place, there would be no way we would have met our goals for this client.
- To expand on the project above, I implemented a full automation CI/CD pipeline for our workflow.  There are still manual steps, such as creating your own promotion branch and manually putting up a PR.  These are things I would like to automate, but don't have the bandwidth as they work fine as is.  I did automate unit tests based on the environment a PR is pointing to along with automatic deployments to our QA and UAT environments as code is merged into those branches, keeping the environments as up to date as possible as smoothly as possible.  The production Deployment isn't automatic based on merge by request of our client, but it is as simple as pushing a single button.  We merge all of the approved branches into MAIN and then click a single button and the code is built and deployed automatically. 
- At Zinc Partners, I have ran many initiatives (epics) from conception all the way through to completion.  One of my favorites so far has been an integration with a large Payroll platform that our client utilizes for payroll.  We have employee data in both systems (the payroll system and the platform we develop) and we needed a way to keep these items in sync.  When an employee updates their data in the Payroll platform, update the customers platform and vice-versa.  I implemented a Java microservice with Spring Boot, hosted on Heroku, that handles this communication.  I have a REST API that listens for a webhook from the Payroll Platform, gets data, transforms it, and sends it off to the customers platform to update it. The same goes for the other way around.  I utilized Java 21 and Spring Boot to build this microservice and no database as this middleware microservice does not retain any data itself, it only accepts, transforms, and sends it on its way. I was able to implement the new Java Virtual Threads in Java 21 with the most revent version of Spring Boot to drastically increase the concurency and overall speed of this system.
- On a non-technical note: At Zinc Partners, I have truly been able to be a mentor to some younger developers. I have been able to lead initiatives with multiple green developers that were just getting into the industry and help teach them how to be better engineers.  This has been a highlight of my career. 

#### A Little Biography
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my career, I have experienced just about every side of the tech industry that you can  (sans sales). I began my technical career in highschool, working for my father who owned a small Web Development shop back in the 90s and early 2000s. We worked in mostly HTML/ColdFusion before CSS was a thing (those were the days)! I remember pushing my first files up to an FTP server using FileZilla and then going to the domain and seeing it live. It was exhilerating to say the least. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After highschool, I ended up joining the United States Army as a 25B (IT Specialist) and enlisting for 6 years, making it to the rank of Sergeant (E5). During that time I received multiple CompTia certifications (A+, Net+, Sec+, amongst others).  I quickly worked my way into a position of leadership and was one of the highest ranking people in my S6(IT) shop (don't get me started on why an E5 with 3 years in the military was leading a Section on his own...). We owned and managed the VoIP stack for the unit which provided all internal phone services wherever we were.  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting out of the Military, I joined a fairly large VoIP Software company in Indiana, getting my foot in the door in the support department as I didn't have a degree at the time.  After a few years I felt burnt out and wanted to continue growing my career so I shifted into the Account Management side of the company becoming a Service Delivery Manager.  I helped roughly 25 customers in their post sales needs for 2 years before realizing that having my hads in the technical work was truly where my heart was.  During my time at this VoIP company, I had been self studying software development and working on little projects on the side.  In my SDM role, I worked closely with the Engineering team to resolve bugs that customers found.  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After building a rappor with themn for multiple years, I was a shoe in when an associate engineering position became available. I worked on the support side of the house, mostly fixing bugs and writing special customziations for special customers, but my team did also own the installer of our platform (it was an on prem service).  We improved the patching and installation process for our product 10x, nearly eliminating any bugs or issues in it.  I was promoted through the ranks fairly quickly, leaving Associate behind after the first year and preparring for another promotion in the not too distant future. During this time, I also completed my bachelors degree (BS in CS) from Western Governors University.  I already got my foot in the door as an engineer, but I wanted to prove that I could get that piece of paper. Fast forward another year and the company had gone through an acquisition, with cutbacks looming.  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After so many years in large organizations, I wanted to move on to where I could make a larger impact.  I found a small startup (in my home town of all places) and came on as one of the first 10 employees. During that time, I was instrumental in architecture and dvelopment of a majority of the backend systems.  I felt fairly new in my software development career still at this point, so I was blown away at the ability to be involved in these processes. I helped design and implement a Logging microservice that utilized RabbitMQ to prevent backing up the workflow after sending off the logging requests. I helped design and build our relational database architecture using PostgreSQL.  I even helped our DevOps lead implement all of the automation such as builds kicknig off via Jenkins when PRs were put up and automated end-to-end testing running in all of our environments nightly.  This was a great place to work and I wish I could remember all of the fun projects I completed over my tenure there. Unfortunately the leadership was unable to provide a concise direction for the platform and I didn't see it growing into the place I would like to spend my career.  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I eventualyl landed with a local consulting firm, where I finally found a place that was growing and where my individual contributions would make a large impact. Over the past three years with the consulting firm, I have truly sunk my teeth into growing a fledgling engineering department.  I was hired as a Senior Engineer with roughly 5 years under my belt at this point, but within the year I was promoted to Engineering Team Lead and had taken over managing the entire engineering department of 15+ people.  I have spearheaded multiple projects such as implementing Source Control for our largest client, decreasing release times from 10+ hours of FTE work to less than 1 hour by utilizing automations that were made possible by implementing source control, and leading numerous high-growth projects for the client. <br> I harp on DRY and KISS mentalities constantly (where it was very Convoluted and not-DRY when I arrived) and have been striving for architectural standards throughout the application, such as SOLID (although we don't practice it completely, it's a great tool to make sure you are thinking through things properly).  I lead an initiatve re-vamping our entire testing suite and multiple integration initiatives with large financial companies such as Paylocity, Paycom, and Stripe. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have truly enjoyed my years in consulting but I am ready to move to to a company where I am not only able to make an impact, but truly own a product.  I want my efforts to go directly to the success of the company I am worknig for and not supporting a 3rd party. I want to continue growing in my career with mentors that can still teach me new things.  I'm looking for my next adventure!
