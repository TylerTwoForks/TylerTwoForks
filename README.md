#### A Little Biography
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my career, I have experienced just about every side of the tech industry that you can  (sans sales). I began my technical career in highschool, working for my father who owned a small Web Development shop back in the 90s and early 2000s. We worked in mostly HTML/ColdFusion before CSS was a thing (those were the days)! I remember pushing my first files up to an FTP server using FileZilla and then going to the domain and seeing it live. It was exhilerating to say the least. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After highschool, I ended up joining the United States Army as a 25B (IT Specialist) and enlisting for 6 years, making it to the rank of Sergeant (E5). During that time I received multiple CompTia certifications (A+, Net+, Sec+, amongst others).  I quickly worked my way into a position of leadership and was one of the highest ranking people in my S6(IT) shop (don't get me started on why an E5 with 3 years in the military was leading a Section on his own...). We owned and managed the VoIP stack for the unit which provided all internal phone services wherever we were.  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting out of the Military, I joined a fairly large VoIP Software company in Indiana, getting my foot in the door in the support department as I didn't have a degree at the time.  After a few years I felt burnt out and wanted to continue growing my career so I shifted into the Account Management side of the company becoming a Service Delivery Manager.  I helped roughly 25 customers in their post sales needs for 2 years before realizing that having my hads in the technical work was truly where my heart was.  During my time at this VoIP company, I had been self studying software development and working on little projects on the side.  In my SDM role, I worked closely with the Engineering team to resolve bugs that customers found.  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After building a rappor with themn for multiple years, I was a shoe in when an associate engineering position became available. I worked on the support side of the house, mostly fixing bugs and writing special customziations for special customers, but my team did also own the installer of our platform (it was an on prem service).  We improved the patching and installation process for our product 10x, nearly eliminating any bugs or issues in it.  I was promoted through the ranks fairly quickly, leaving Associate behind after the first year and preparring for another promotion in the not too distant future. During this time, I also completed my bachelors degree (BS in CS) from Western Governors University.  I already got my foot in the door as an engineer, but I wanted to prove that I could get that piece of paper. Fast forward another year and the company had gone through an acquisition, with cutbacks looming.  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After so many years in large organizations, I wanted to move on to where I could make a larger impact.  I found a small startup (in my home town of all places) and came on as one of the first 10 employees. During that time, I was instrumental in architecture and dvelopment of a majority of the backend systems.  I felt fairly new in my software development career still at this point, so I was blown away at the ability to be involved in these processes. I helped design and implement a Logging microservice that utilized RabbitMQ to prevent backing up the workflow after sending off the logging requests. I helped design and build our relational database architecture using PostgreSQL.  I even helped our DevOps lead implement all of the automation such as builds kicknig off via Jenkins when PRs were put up and automated end-to-end testing running in all of our environments nightly.  This was a great place to work and I wish I could remember all of the fun projects I completed over my tenure there. Unfortunately the leadership was unable to provide a concise direction for the platform and I didn't see it growing into the place I would like to spend my career.  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I eventualyl landed with a local consulting firm, where I finally found a place that was growing and where my individual contributions would make a large impact. Over the past three years with the consulting firm, I have truly sunk my teeth into growing a fledgling engineering department.  I was hired as a Senior Engineer with roughly 5 years under my belt at this point, but within the year I was promoted to Engineering Team Lead and had taken over managing the entire engineering department of 15+ people.  I have spearheaded multiple projects such as implementing Source Control for our largest client, decreasing release times from 10+ hours of FTE work to less than 1 hour by utilizing automations that were made possible by implementing source control, and leading numerous high-growth projects for the client. <br> I harp on DRY and KISS mentalities constantly (where it was very Convoluted and not-DRY when I arrived) and have been striving for architectural standards throughout the application, such as SOLID (although we don't practice it completely, it's a great tool to make sure you are thinking through things properly).  I lead an initiatve re-vamping our entire testing suite and multiple integration initiatives with large financial companies such as Paylocity, Paycom, and Stripe. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have truly enjoyed my years in consulting but I am ready to move to to a company where I am not only able to make an impact, but truly own a product.  I want my efforts to go directly to the success of the company I am worknig for and not supporting a 3rd party. I want to continue growing in my career with mentors that can still teach me new things.  I'm looking for my next adventure!
